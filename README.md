## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design principles
- Modern CSS techniques (CSS Grid, custom properties)
- Accessibility best practices

### What I learned

During this project, I gained valuable experience with several key concepts:

**Responsive Design Implementation:**
```css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .product-card {
    flex-direction: row;
    max-width: 600px;
    min-height: 450px;
  }
}
```

**CSS Custom Properties for Consistent Theming:**
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
  --secondary-color: hsl(228, 12%, 48%);
  --background-color: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);
}
```

**Modern CSS Layout Techniques:**
I learned how to effectively use Flexbox for complex layouts and CSS Grid for responsive design, which significantly improved my ability to create professional-looking components.

**Accessibility Considerations:**
I implemented proper focus states and semantic HTML structure to ensure the component is accessible to all users.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on:

- Advanced CSS animations and transitions
- More complex responsive design patterns
- CSS architecture and maintainability
- Performance optimization techniques
- Advanced accessibility features

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Helped me understand complex flexbox layouts
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Essential reference for CSS properties and techniques
- [Frontend Mentor Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) - Great place to get feedback and learn from others
